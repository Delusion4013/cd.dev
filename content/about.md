## 👋🏻Hi



Welcome to my Blog. 



I just completed my Bachelor degree this year, majoring in 💻Computer Science with a specialization on 🤖Artificial Intelligence. 



I am now working as an 💬NLP researcher in a tech company located in 📍Hangzhou. 



I am interested in exploring areas including machine learning, artificial intelligence, 📊data science, 💰financial analysis and general methodologies. Here you could find my 📓notes and 🧐thinking on these areas.



Besides, I am *INTJ* type from the [16 personalities test](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test), which I found most descriptions fitted myself pretty well.
